/**
 * DiLink 5 parked keep-alive lease.
 *
 * <p>Holds the local parked transport state, MCU/sentry rails, optionally the
 * panorama producer, and — only after a recorded on-car pre-flight — a vendor
 * shutdown-critical token, while the vehicle is parked and the user has opted in. Runs inside
 * {@code acc_sentry_daemon} and is driven by two callers only:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #requestForTransition(long, boolean)} from a generation-fenced
 *       {@code LatestBooleanReconciler} on every sentry transition (ACC OFF →
 *       desired, ACC ON → locally detached without parked link STOP);</li>
 *   <li>{@link #tick(long)} from the daemon's 10 s keep-alive loop, which
 *       re-reads the configuration, samples the 12 V battery when available and
 *       re-asserts or releases the levers.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Invariants:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Nothing is written while the master switch is off or the kill switch is
 *       set. Because the DiLink 5 OTA voltage API is unavailable from the shell
 *       daemon on some vehicles, a missing/stale sample is diagnostic-only once
 *       the user explicitly enables this feature. A fresh,
 *       confirmed low-voltage sequence still releases and latches every lever.</li>
 *   <li>Deliberately NOT gated on the camera-mode selection: DiLink 5 head units
 *       exist with and without the QCarCam camera stack, so the user's opt-in
 *       toggle is the platform declaration. The lease is installed on every
 *       platform and stays inert until that toggle is ON.</li>
 *   <li>The {@link Di5KeepAliveOwnershipMarker} is written BEFORE the first HAL
 *       write and removed AFTER the last release; start-up hygiene releases only
 *       what the marker records.</li>
 *   <li>parked link START is callback-confirmed and periodically re-asserted.
 *       ACC ON cancels local ownership and unbinds without sending global STOP;
 *       STOP is reserved for a deliberate parked-session end (toggle/kill switch,
 *       voltage cutoff, or daemon exit while still parked).</li>
 *   <li>The 12 V cutoff latches until ACC ON or confirmed external charging.</li>
 *   <li>Sentry flags are written only when {@code getMcuStatus()} reports the MCU
 *       awake ({@code 1} or {@code 10}); otherwise {@code wakeUpMcu()} is polled,
 *       bounded, and the flags wait for the next attempt.</li>
 *   <li>The MCU power hold ({@code -1442840502 ← 1}, OEM-app V1 parity) is
 *       written unconditionally at assert time — the 1 IS the wake request, so
 *       it must not be gated on {@code getMcuStatus()} (the documented DiLink 4
 *       rail-collapse mistake). The release-side {@code ← 0} ("request MCU
 *       sleep") is issued ONLY when this install asserted the 1 or a marker
 *       recorded it — never as a bare cleanup.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>All hardware and I/O go through {@link Hardware} so the state machine is
 * unit-testable on the JVM.
